I am a second year Data Science Masters student in the Psychology department of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I love coming up with creative soloutions to complex research problems as well as designing detailed and unique studies. For me, learning is a way of life which is reflected in my continually growing portfolio where I showcase my newly aquired skills and abilities.
